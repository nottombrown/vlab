Provides a thumbnail area in Your Profile, for users to upload & crop new images in an overlay to be saved and stored to their profile.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a thumbnail area in the Your Profile section, where users can upload & crop new images in an overlay and upon cropping the image, the new image will be saved and stored. This gives users with any role the chance to easily upload an image and view their current thumbnail, all in one go. In Discussion, the default image associated with the user will be replaced with the user avatar image uploaded and this will then be the image shown in comments and also in People Lists (see below).

**This plugin was developed for [People Lists](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/people-lists/ "People Lists WordPress Plugin Homepage") and this plugin  provides a rich text editor on the profile page for easy modifications of specific user profile information that can be displayed on any page using the [people-lists list=example-list] shortcode. Admins will also be able to add custom fields to the Your Profile section on Wordpress and these fields can be displayed on any page using the People Lists template (which can be styled using HTML) that provides codes for every field that is desired to be displayed.  There is a specific code in People Lists that hooks this thumbnail into your lists template display, so grab People Lists plugin as well!!**
